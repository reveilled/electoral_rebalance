In the US there are growing calls to abolish the electoral college. The number of votes for each state is determined by the number of Representatives in the House and the number of Senators in the Senate for each state. The House of Representatives has not increased in size since the last increase to 435 in 1911, when the US population was approximately 92 million people (1910 census). While we're waiting for the 2020 census to wrap up, the 2010 census had the us population at approximately 309 million people. That's 336% more people for the pool of 435 Representatives to represent and be distributed amongst. It also means less populus states are massively overrepresented in electoral college once the Representative are apportioned.

The point of this repo is to analyze the effects on the the electoral college if the number of representatives was increased in the house. It will reanalyze the results of the elections from 2000-2016 assuming the increase having taken effect some time after the 1990 census.
